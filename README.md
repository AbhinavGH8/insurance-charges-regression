## 📂 Project Overview

This project uses a dataset of health insurance policyholders to predict `charges` (medical insurance costs) based on:
- Age
- Sex
- BMI
- Number of Children
- Smoking Status
- Residential Region

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Name**: `insurance.csv`
- **Rows**: 1,338
- **Source**: [Kaggle Insurance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The notebook includes:
- Distribution plots of age, BMI, and charges
- Count plots for categorical variables like gender, region, and smoking status
- Correlation analysis and feature transformation

---

## 🧪 Machine Learning Pipeline

- **Label Encoding** for categorical features
- **Train/Test Split** using `train_test_split`
- Regression model training (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Evaluation using MAE, MSE, and R²
